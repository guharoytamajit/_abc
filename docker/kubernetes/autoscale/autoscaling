prequisites:
1)metrics-server or heapster should be active
2)resource request must be there in container

autoscaling is applied on deployment.
horizontal pod autoscaling(HPA): increase no of pods based on some condition.common in web apps.
vertical pod autoscaling:increase pod resource on some condition. common in RDBMS instance.


example:
>kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment name> --cpu-percent 200 --min 1 --max 3 

--cpu-percent => it is the avarage cpu percentage with respect to cpu provided in resource request.
                 if resource cpu request is '10m' or .01 core then , 20m (or 200%) of cpu consumption will trigger auto scale


>kubectl get hpa
>kubectl describe hpa <hpa name(same as deployment name)>   #here in event section we can see autoscale event logs,ond other inportant details

we can get yaml content as:
>kubectl get hpa <name> -o yaml
now we can save this yaml,modify and apply.
