=============
It uses a packaging format called charts.

chart:
Collection of files that describe a set of kubernetes resources.
A single chart can deploy an app or a database.
At chart can have dependencies eg. wordpress chart has dependency on mysql chart.
Charts use templates that are typically developed by package maintainer.They will generate yaml file which k8s understands.  
You can think of chart templates as dynamic yaml files which can contail logic and variables.

Sample template:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-configmap
data:
  myvalue: "Hello World"
  drink: {{ .Values.favouriteDrink }}

=>here "favouriteDrink" value can be overridden by the user when running "helm install"

>helm init
>helm version
>helm install --name my-release --set mysqlRootPassword=secretpassword,mysqlUser=my-user,mysqlPassword=my-password,mysqlDatabase=my-database  stable/mysql

OR

helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/mysql
