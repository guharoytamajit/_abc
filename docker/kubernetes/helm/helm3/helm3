Helm 3 doesnot require tiller,all the access to your cluster will be based on .kube/config file.

There a different in helm install command:
helm2:
>helm install stable/redis --name redis  # --name refers to the release name

helm3:
>helm install  redis  stable/redis       #no need to pass --name attribute just pass the value

migrate from helm 2 to 3:

scenario:
suppose we are already using helm 2, tiller is running on server and many charts are already deployed using helm2


solution:
there are two things to migrate:
1)helm configuration migration from 2 ->3
2)we have to migrate all chart apps which were deployed using helm2. 


Download helm v3 binary rename it as "helm -> helm3"  and place it in /use/local/bin(ie. in path)

>helm3 version --short

>helm list #will list all helm 2 charts

>helm3 list   #lists all helm 3 charts 

We will install a helm plugin which will convert helm2 -> helm3
>helm3 plugin install https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3

verify if the plugin is installed:
>helm3 plugin list
