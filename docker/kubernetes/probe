Readiness probe: Tells if a pod is ready to serve requests
Configured inside container.
This is mandatory when using scaling.
When your application scales up it may not be immediately available for taking requests,but service will still forward a few requests in new pods in round-robin order.

With following command we can see new pod is not immediately available,so those requests will fail ultil the webserver starts up.
>while true;do curl http://endpoint; done

With readiness probe applied services will not send any request to new containers until it is ready(eg. an endpoint returns 200,it will keep checking after a configurable interval until it is ready)

these events can be seen using "kubectl describe pod"

--------------

Liveness probe:This will continueously run during the lifetime of container(eg. an endpoint returns 200),it will keep checking after a configurable interval.
If the check fails(failureThreshhold reached),it restarts the container
==================
parameters of readiness and liveness probe:
1)initialDelaysSecond
2)periodSeconds:default 10 secs, min 1sec.
3)timeout: default 1 sec,minimum 1sec
4)successThreshhold:default 1,No consicutive successto consider service is up and running.
5)failureThreshhold:default 3
