Admission Controllers(AC):
A piece of code that intercepts the request to API server after authentication and authorization but prior to persistance in etcd.
AC can reject or modify request based on custom logic.

Two types of AC:
1)Validating(eg PodSecurityPolicy).  For example make sure pods are not created in privileged mode
2)Mutating(eg PodNodeSelector ). For example Change api object to add/remove capabilitieseg  nodeselector: env=prod


Admission Controllers examples:
AlwaysPullImages
PodNodeSelector
PodSecurityPolicy
LimitRanger
NamespaceExists
EventRateLimit
