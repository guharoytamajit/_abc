Capture Packets from Specific Interface:
>tcpdump -i eth0

Capture Only N Number of Packets:
>tcpdump -c 5 -i eth0

Print Captured Packets in ASCII:
>tcpdump -A -i eth0

Display Available Interfaces:
>tcpdump -D

Capture and Save Packets in a File:
>tcpdump -w 0001.pcap -i eth0


Read Captured Packets File:
>tcpdump -r 0001.pcap

Capture only TCP Packets:
>tcpdump -i eth0 tcp

Capture Packet from Specific Port:
>tcpdump -i eth0 port 22

find traffic using port ranges
>tcpdump portrange 21-23

Capture Packets from source IP:
> tcpdump -i eth0 src 192.168.0.2

Capture Packets from destination IP:
>tcpdump -i eth0 dst 50.116.66.139

Capture Packets to or from IP:
>tcpdump host 1.1.1.1

finding packets by network cidr:
>tcpdump net 1.2.3.0/24

show only ip6 traffic:
>tcpdump ip6

find traffic based on packet size:
>tcpdump less 32
>tcpdump greater 64
>tcpdump <= 128


 find all traffic from 10.5.2.3 going to any host on port 3389:
 >tcpdump -nnvvS src 10.5.2.3 and dst port 3389

 all traffic coming from 192.168.x.x and going to the 10.x or 172.16.x.x networks:
 >tcpdump -nvX src net 192.168.0.0/16 and dst net 10.0.0.0/8 or 172.16.0.0/16


all traffic going to 192.168.0.2 that is not ICMP.
>tcpdump dst 192.168.0.2 and src net and not icmp

This will show us all traffic from a host that isn’t SSH traffic (assuming default port usage):
>tcpdump -vv src mars and not dst port 22

And / Or operation:
>tcpdump 'src 10.0.2.4 and (dst port 3389 or 22)'


Here are some additional ways to tweak how you call tcpdump.

-X : Show the packet’s contents in both hex and ascii.
-XX : Same as -X, but also shows the ethernet header.
-D : Show the list of available interfaces
-l : Line-readable output (for viewing as you save, or sending to other commands)
-q : Be less verbose (more quiet) with your output.
-t : Give human-readable timestamp output.
-tttt : Give maximally human-readable timestamp output.
-i eth0 : Listen on the eth0 interface.
-vv : Verbose output (more v’s gives more output).
-c : Only get x number of packets and then stop.
-s : Define the snaplength (size) of the capture in bytes. Use -s0 to get everything, unless you are intentionally capturing less.
-S : Print absolute sequence numbers.
-e : Get the ethernet header as well.
-q : Show less protocol information.
-E : Decrypt IPSEC traffic by providing an encryption key.

tcpdump -D
tcpdump -nni eth0 -vvv -A  src host 192.168.0.100 and tcp and port 80
