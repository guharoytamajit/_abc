Istio is a service mesh
Istio is not going to be replacement for k8s, its an extra layer of software deployed along side k8s.
Any kind of software with distributed architecture(eg k8s) would benefit from service mesh

What is service mesh:
on k8s containers would directly communicate with each other
With service mesh architecture,container will talk to each other via service mesh.
the advantage here is service mesh is not only aware of all interaction(useful in telemetry) but they can also add some processing.
see fig istio01.png

mesh is aware of:
which container is calling which container
how much time it take for response
what is the response content and code 

How istio works:
Istio adds a proxy container to every pods to intercept all network calls
see figure istio02.png

all proxies are collectively called "data plane" in istio,everything else(istio deployed in cluster) is called "control plane"
see figure istio03.png and istio04.png
control plane=>istio-telemetry,istio-pilot,istio-tracing etc

install minikube.

>minikube delete
>minikube start --memory 8000

goto resources/warmup-exercise
it has 4 files:
1-istio-init.yaml              
2-istio-minikube-reduced.yaml  
3-kiali-secret.yaml
4-application-full-stack.yaml

first 3 are for installing istio  , last one is for deploying a sample app.
>kubectl apply -f 1-istio-init.yaml 
//will create istio-system namespace which has all control plane components
//it will also create few "custom resource definition"(CRD),which is created by running few k8s jobs which can be viewed as:
>kubectl get po -n istio-system  //we can see k8s jobs which creates custom k8s types for istio
we should wait until above three jobs complete,before using istio
>kubectl get crd //see all the "custom resource definition" installed by above jobs

>kubectl apply -f 2-istio-minikube-reduced.yaml
//it will create all istio control plane components
//now wait until all pods are up,few containers may fail at first be we need to wait a bit
>watch kubectl get po -n istio-system 

when all pods are either completed or running then we may proceed.

>kubectl apply -f 3-kiali-secret.yaml //this will install secret file for kiali

In istio pod list you will see a sidecar injection pod, which is responsible for adding "data plane" proxy container to every pod
"sidecar" is an extra component to your pod doing some extra help(helper container)
sidecar is more generic term in istio by side car we refer to proxy container
proxy can be also refered by envoy(more on envoy later)

by default sidecar will not do anything,to enable sidecar injection to any namespace we have to add a label istio-injection=enable to that namespace.Now all pods in this namespace will have this istio proxy.

Lets add this label in default kibernetes namespace:
>kubectl describe ns default //get details of default name space
>kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enable  //adding label to default k8s namespace

>kubectl get ns default -o yaml// verify if label has been attached.


>kubectl apply -f 4-application-full-stack.yaml //deploy application
>watch kubectl get po //see all application pods
here you will see all pods now has two containers, extra container is the proxy container injected by sidecar-injector

>kubectl get pods

----------------------
Envoy:
opensource edge and service proxy designed for cloud native application.
Istio uses envoy for proxy(sidecar)
envoy can also be used without istio,but it is very low level software and generally used with another software like istio

envoy has no direct relation with kubernetes,istio creates "custom resource definition"(CRD) eg. virtualservices which translates into envoy configurations.This way Istio enables k8s engineer to use envoy without low level details.

Control plane components:

Galley(istio-galley-5b597b94bb-jqsrx pod):
Galley reads in our k8s yaml and transforms it into an internal structure that istio understands.
This means that istio can work with non k8s softwares like consul.So when working with consul galley will translate consul configuration into an internal structure that istio understands.


Pilot(istio-pilot-5d454cbb46-pr4h7   pod):
As input it takes configuration in internal structure that istio understands from galley
Pilot is responsible for converting the configuration into a format that envoy understands.
It is also responsible for propogating the configurations to proxies(envoy containers)
 
Citadel:
Manages TSL certificates,to have secure communication between proxies.
This means we can enable TLS/SSL across entire cluster

Mixer(may be removed in the future)
Takes care of policy check(eg upto 10 request per sec) and telemetry.
In list of pod we see separate pods for telemetry and policy,so it is already divided into multi components
==============================================
telemetry:

goto resources/1 Telemetry and install yaml one by one(you may need to wait for 1st 2 yaml)

requirements:
you need envoy proxy running on each pod you want to  monitor
the comtrol plane needs to be running(check if telemetry pod running)
you donot need istio specific yaml like VirtualService or Gateway to use telemetry


kiali:
check port where kiali is running
>kubectl get svc -n istio-system
 then hit <minikube ip>:port
