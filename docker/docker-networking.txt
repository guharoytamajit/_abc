docker network ls #list all networks
docker network inspect <networkname> 


If we start a container by debault it will boin network named bridge
>docker run -it -d ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash
>docker network ls

>docker network inspect bridge  #it will also show containers in this network

>docker network create –-driver <drivername> <networkname>



To attach a container to a network
>docker network create --driver bridge new_nw
>docker run –it –-network new_nw ubuntu:latest /bin/bash


The most common network types(driver) being:  bridge,  overlay, and  macvlan.
Bridge Networks:
 It is limited to containers within a single host running the Docker engine. 
 The bridge driver creates a private network internal to the host so containers on this network can communicate.
 External access is granted by exposing ports to containers.

  docker network create -d bridge my-bridge-net

Overlay Networks:
  In Docker, an overlay network driver is used for multi-host network communication. 
  VXLAN solves common portability limitations by extending layer 2 subnets across layer 3 network boundaries, hence containers can run on foreign IP subnets.
  To create an overlay network named my-overlay-net, you’ll also need the --subnet parameter to specify the network block that Docker will use to assign IP addresses to the containers:

  docker network create -d overlay --subnet=192.168.10.0/24 my-overlay-net
