PID Namespace:


Processes in linux live in a tree-like structure. Each process in the kernel has a unique process identifier, called a “pid” for short. The record for each process in the tracks the pid of its a immediate parent. The pid is also passed to the parent when the a process is created via the fork syscall. The kernel generates a new pid for the child and returns the identifier to the calling process, but it is up to the parent to keep track of this pid manually.

The first process started by the kernel has pid 1. This process is referred to as the init process, or simply ‘init’. The parent pid of init is pid 0, signifying that its parent is the kernel. Pid 1 is the root of the user-space process tree: It is possible to reach pid 1 on a linux system from any process by recursively following each process’ parent. If pid 1 dies, the kernel will panic and you have to reboot the machine.
