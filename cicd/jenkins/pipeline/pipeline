A pipeline can have multiple stages(eg code checkout,build,test,deploy etc)
Each stage can  have n number of steps

Install pipeline plugin:
Manage Jenkins>Manage Plugins  
search "pipeline" , download it if not already installed.
Now you will see option to create a pipeline project


we have two types of pipeline:
1)Declarative pipeline:
Declarative approch,more readable

eg.
pipeline {
    agent any 
    stages {
        stage('Build') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
    }
}

Note:	agent is Declarative Pipeline-specific syntax that instructs Jenkins to allocate an executor (on a node) and workspace for the entire Pipeline.

2)Scripted pipeline
More verbose but more control
eg.
node {  
    stage('Build') { 
        // 
    }
    stage('Test') { 
        // 
    }
    stage('Deploy') { 
        // 
    }
}

Note: node is Scripted Pipeline-specific syntax that instructs Jenkins to execute this Pipeline (and any stages contained within it), on any available agent/node. This is effectively equivalent to agent in Declarative Pipeline-specific syntax.

======================
A Pipeline can be created in one of the following ways:

1)Through Blue Ocean - after setting up a Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, the Blue Ocean UI helps you write your Pipeline’s Jenkinsfile and commit it to source control.
2)Through the classic UI - you can enter a basic Pipeline directly in Jenkins through the classic UI.
3)In SCM - you can write a Jenkinsfile manually, which you can commit to your project’s source control repository.
