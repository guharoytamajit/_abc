Local, Remote and Virtual Repositories
Artifactory hosts two kinds of repositories: local and remote. Both local and remote repositories can be aggregated under virtual repositories.


Local Repositories
Local repositories are physical locally-managed repositories that one can deploy artifacts into.
Artifacts under a local repository are directly accessible via a URL pattern of
http://<host>:<port>/artifactory/<local-repository-name>/<artifact-path>

================================================
Local repositories: are physical, locally-managed repositories into which you can deploy artifacts.

A remote repository: serves as a caching proxy for a repository managed at a remote URL (which may itself be another Artifactory remote repository).
Artifacts are stored and updated in remote repositories according to various configuration parameters that control the caching and proxying behavior. You can remove artifacts from a remote repository cache but you cannot actually deploy a new artifact into a remote repository.

A virtual repository: (or "repository group") aggregates several repositories with the same package type under a common URL.

===========================================
Artifactory comes with integrated tomcat,hence we can interact with it as a web application.
Artifactory is like a war deployed in tomcat,running in 8081 port by default.
