Tmux Resurrect Usages
Installation
To install Tmux Resurrect, it is recommended to install Tmux Plugin Manager first. Please check the GitHub repo for installation instructions.



Then we add new plugin Tmux Resurrect to Tmux by adding set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect' to ~/.tmux.conf. An example of the ~/.tmux.conf would be

$ cat ~/.tmux.conf 
# List of plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'

# Other examples:
# set -g @plugin 'github_username/plugin_name'
# set -g @plugin 'git@github.com/user/plugin'
# set -g @plugin 'git@bitbucket.com/user/plugin'

# Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep this line at the very bottom of tmux.conf)
run -b '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
Finally we install the plugin by hitting Ctrl + b + I in the Tmux terminal. We would see the following information if the installation was successful.

                                                                         [0/0]
TMUX environment reloaded.
Done, press ESCAPE to continue.
Save and Restore Tmux Environment
To save the Tmux environment, we hit Ctrl + b + Ctrl + s in the Tmux Terminal. If the save was successful, a message of Tmux environment saved! would pop up.



To restore the Tmux environment, we hit Ctrl + b + Ctrl + r in the Tmux Terminal. If the restore was successful, a message of Tmux restore complete! would pop up.



All the sessions, windows, and panels would be saved and restored with Tmux Resurrect. Some of the running commands, such as htop, would be restored as well.
====================

Customizing Tmux
When Tmux is started, it reads its configuration parameters from ~/.tmux.conf if the file is present


~/.tmux.conf
# Improve colors
set -g default-terminal 'screen-256color'

# Set scrollback buffer to 10000
set -g history-limit 10000

# Customize the status line
set -g status-fg  green
set -g status-bg  black
