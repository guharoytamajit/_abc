In many linux distribution when a user is created he is also added to a group with same as username
>less /etc/passwd  //stores user details
Here you will see even services have accound but then are not assigned any shell(/sbin/nologin)
>less /etc/shadow  //stores password in encrypted form 
>passwd jim  //add password,expiry,lock details  for jim user


>cd /etc/skel/  //this directory holds the default home structure for any account.
If we add any file in skel directory it will be added in all user's home

    
>usermod --help //can be used to change username/password/group  ,lock/unlock account,change home etc
>userdel -r jim // -r makes sure home directory is deleted


Suppose an organization has departments like hr,sales. Now instead of giving permissions to individual users we can add users to different groups say HR or sales. Then give a set of priviledge to these groups.

>groupadd sales
>groupadd hr

>less /etc/group // all group details

Changing group of user:
we use usermod with following flags:
-g =>changes primary group,users primary group is  a group with same name as user
-G =>change supplementary group.This will overwrite not append. we can use "," as delimiter for passing multiple groups.
-a =>add user to a supplementary group.

>usermod  -aG sales jim

>groupmod --help
>groupdel hr //delete group hr
