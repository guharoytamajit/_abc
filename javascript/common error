Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached, watch 
------------------------
solution:
The meaning of this error is that the number of files monitored by the system has reached the limit!!

Modify the number of system monitoring files

Ubuntu

sudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf

Add a line at the bottom

fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288

Then save and exit!

sudo sysctl -p

to check it

Then it is solved
