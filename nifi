Apache Nifi supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing,transformation and system mediation logic.
Important features:
Can create data pipeline which scales across cluster.
Guaranteed delivery/No data loss
Supports data buffering,back ressure,priority queuing
drag drop interface.
Implements all common integration patterns routing,filtering,transforming etc.
Lots of templates available online to reuse.

What it is not good for:
Distributed computing
Complex event processing
Joins,rolling window,aggregation operations.

Good for basic transforming,enriching as ETL.Should avoid when compution logic is complex and expensive(Use Spark/Flink instead).

Building blocks:
1.FlowFile:
  It is basically the data
  Comprises of two element:  a)Content=>data itself,  b)Attributes=>matadata(key-value) 
  Always Gets persisted to disk (not memory) after creation
  
2.Processor:
  Applies a set of transformations and rules to FlowFiles(data) to generate a new FlowFile.
  Any Processor can process any FlowFile.
  They are all running parallel in different threads.
   Processor can update,add or remove FlowFile attributes    and/or  change  FlowFile content

3.Connector(buffer between Processor):
  Connects Processors
  Queue of FlowFiles that are yet t be processed by the next Processor.
  Can define Priorities,backpressure etc
