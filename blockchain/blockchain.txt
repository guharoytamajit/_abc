Hyperledger is an ecosystem which has lots of blockchain related projects

Fabric:
Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain framework implementation .
Allows us to use distributed ledger.
Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play. 
Hyperledger Fabric leverages container technology to host smart contracts called chaincode that comprise the application logic of the system

We can think of fabric as "Decentralized system for exchange of value(Asset)"

-----------------
Asset:
represents the value
can be tangible eg car or intangible eg. stock ownership certificate,reward points


use-case:
in car industry we can have three entities car manufacturer,dealer,customer.
manufacturer can have a book of records: 1)car created 2)ownership transferred to dealer
dealer can have a book of records: 1)received car from manufacturer 2)ownership transferred to customer
These book of records are called "Ledgers"
Each entity can maintain their own ledger
car manufacture may have baught different car parts from different entities,they all will have their own ledger,they inturn buy raw material from some other sources(which can have ledger too)
now the customer can sell his car to another person soon this becomes hard to maintain
Further different entities ledger may contradict as well,which is another bigger broblem
Distributed ledger Tecnology(DLT) solves this problem

DLT: each entity involved in exchanging value holds a replica of common book of records,now ledgers are consistent(each entity have a copy of ledger).

challanges of DLT:
1)consistency:maintaining consistencies across all copies of ledger
2)privacy: we may not want to make this ledger public, or maybe we want to share this to only specific entities
3)inter-operatibility

Fabric is a DLT framework which takes care of above problems
Decentralized: decentralization is achieved using distributed ledger(not maintain a single copy in a single place)
It focuses on bulding non-public blockchain


Fabric creates permissioned network ie. restricts who can access and do what on network ,in other words "network participants are known"
In this network different users have a specific roles and they are allowed to perform specific actions.

Chaincode:
Business logc of allowed transaction or the transaction that can be executed against the assets, eg transfer of ownership

Legder: records all transactions,also records state change of asset(eg. change of owner)

fabric has a component called "Membership Service Provider",which makes this a permissioned network(all users are known and have a role)
