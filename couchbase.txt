membase + couchdb

cluster based supports persistance,partitions,replication
document oriented nosql

can be accessed using webui,cli,rest.

vbucket(virtual bucket)=>partition
bucket=>database
record=>document

vbucket is part of bucket


the overall keyspace is partitioned into 1024 logical storage unit called vbuckets.
vbuckets are distributed across machines within cluster.
details of vbucket are maintained in a map, which is shared among all servers and also client library.
basic unit of storage is a json document which is associated with a key.
uses KETAMA algo to get hash value of a doc id(key)
each key is hashed to a vbucket
When machines are added and removed in the cluster.  The administrator can request a redistribution of vBucket so that data are evenly spread across physical machines.
high availability is achieved through data replication at vbucket level.
if replication factor=2 we will have 1024*2=2048 vbuckets.
========================
Evolution of couchbase:
1.memcached created
2.memcached =>membase (a distributed and persisted key-value store)
3.couchbase=couchbase+membase. json support ,map-reduce indexes, elastic search integration and cross data center replication.
