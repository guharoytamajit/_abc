Network namespaces are used by containers like docker to implement network isolation
When we create a container we want it to me isolated from host machine(it does not see any processes in host or any other container )
container only sees the processes run by it and thinks it  is running on its own host
the host machine however has visibility of all the processes running on different container.


we can list process using following command(both in container and host):
>ps aux

from host machine we will be able to see process running in container but with a different pid


Our host has its own NIC eg eth0 connected to LAN,also it has its own:
1)Routing table
2)ARP table


When a container is created ,a new network namespace is  created for it(for network isolation) 	 
Container will have its own virtual NIC and its own: 
1)Routing table
2)ARP table


Create a new network NS:
>ip netns add <name>

Lets create two network ns(we will refer it as NNS)
>ip netns add red
>ip netns add blue

list NNS:
>ip netns

list interfaces of host:
>ip link

list interfaces of NNS:
>ip netns exec red ip link
OR
>ip -n red link
