download flutter*.zip for your OS
unzip it , add its  bin on $PATH

>flutter --version

>flutter doctor   //this command will tell us if our stttings are okay.

create a flutter workspace say E:/flutterworkspace
open command command prompt in flutter workspace and create your app using following command 
>flutter create first_app


install AndroidStudio
we can create a new emulator from tools>AVD Manager (enable hardware accelerator  for better performance)
then open our first_app project using AndroidStudio

Install dara and flutter plugin:
AndroidStudio will ask you to install missing dart plug-in(see install_plugin.PNG). we need to install it.
It will ask to restart AndroidStudio ,restart it 
At bottom right it will display "plugin suggestion" (plugin_suggestion.PNG) expand it and click "configure plugin" then ok.This will install flutter plugin.You can restart again.

install google ubs driver:
goto settings search for "android sdk", inside "sdk tools" tab select google usb driver see google_usb_driver.PNG

if android sdk is not in the default location which is C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
we need to set ANDROID_HOME env variable which will point to android sdk location.
and to set PATH=%ANDROID_HOME%/tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
Note: you can identify android sdk location by presence of folders like emulator,build-tools,platforms,platform-tool etc
========

main() function inside lib/main.dart is the starting point of your flutter app and we should not rename the file .
