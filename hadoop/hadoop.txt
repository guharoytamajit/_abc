Using the ChainMapper and the ChainReducer classes is possible to compose Map/Reduce jobs that look like [MAP+ / REDUCE MAP*]. And immediate benefit of this pattern is a dramatic reduction in disk IO.

IMPORTANT: There is no need to specify the output key/value classes for the ChainMapper, this is done by the addMapper for the last mapper in the chain.
