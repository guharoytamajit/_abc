Map only operation:(verify them on Jobhistory server YARN. To check shuffling Take a look at counters>reduce shuffle bytes)
>select * from user where id-123;

Map and Reduce operation with little shuffle:
>select count(*) from user;


Map and Reduce operation with more shuffle:(as it makes sure all states are together)
>select avg(id) from user where state < 'LA' group by state  


join operations will have large shuffle 

some hive queries may launch more than one MR job:for example  join followed by sort by clause
Our goal should be reduce shuffle as much as possible, for example if you are doing same join multiple times you should instead make a prejoin table and reuse it.
