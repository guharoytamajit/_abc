Partitioning strategies:
1.Automatic sharding:
  partitions are split when data exceeds a threshhold 
  newly created partitions are relocated to a host with less data
  similar to mongo auto sharding,bigtable

2.Fixed partition assignment:
  Namespace is divided into  Q evenly sized partitions.
  Q/N partitions assigned per host where N => No. of host.
  New Joining host steals partitions evenly from hosts
  similar to dynamodb("strategy 3" in dynamo paper)

3.Random token assignment:
  Each host assigned T random tokens
  T random tokens generated for joining hosts; New tokens divide existing ranges.
  Identical to  classic cassandra when T=1
