Apache Oozie is a server-based workflow scheduling system to manage Hadoop jobs. 

A workflow specifies a set of actions and the order and conditions under which those actions should be performed.
few action may be dependent on another which needs to be run serially. 
Other actions may be independent of one another can are parallelly
a workflow can be represented using a DAG.

Workflows, Coordinators, Bundles all come together to form the building blocks of Oozie.
Oozie is an orchestration system for Hadoop jobs.

actions can be mapreduce,hive query,pig script,shell,java program etc

multiple action forms a workflow(DAG of actions)

At any point you might have 1000s of Hadoop jobs running, many of which would be inter-dependent on one another.

Managing these manually or with basic scripting does not scale.

Oozie allows orchestration and control of such complex multi-stage Hadoop jobs.

Multi-stage Hadoop jobs can then be run as a single Oozie job - the Oozie job is the only thing for you to manage!

===============

You may have multiple Workflows to manage.You can manually process each of these workflows and execute them.

That can get onerous, it’s much easier to have some kind of controlling mechanism for individual workflows.

You might want workflows to run at a certain time and frequency.

Provided the input to the workflow is available.

This needs a Coordinator!

Coordinator:
   The Coordinator schedules the execution of a workflow at a specified time and/or a specified frequency.

   If input data is not available then the workflow is delayed till the data becomes available.

   If no input data is needed then the workflow runs purely at a specified time or frequency.

=======================
For Manufacturing a Car there can be several workflows:
eg Workflow for engine,Workflow for tire etc.

Each of these workflows can have a coordinator.

All these workflows come together and can build a car!

A car is built with a collection of Coordinator jobs.

Bundle:
A collection of Coordinator jobs which can be started,stopped and modified together is called a Bundle!

Data Pipelines:
In Bundle the output of one Coordinator job managing a workflow can be the input to another Coordinator job.


================
The application can be a workflow run manually, a single coordinator or a number of coordinators forming a bundle.

workflow.xml, coordinator.xml,bundle.xml files describe their corresponding applications.

Oozie expects all files to be in HDFS before it can run.

These XML files along with other files which are required for the Oozie application are copied over to HDFS before the job can run.

Oozie Architecture(see oozie-highlevel-architecture.JPG)

Oozie Server:
Runs in a web container such as Apache Tomcat.
Manages Oozie job scheduling and execution.
Is stateless, and holds job related information in the database.

Oozie Client:
Uses a command line interface to talk to the server.
The server provides a REST API and a Java client so Oozie clients can be written in any language.

Hadoop Cluster:
The Oozie server is a client of Hadoop.
Oozie applications read their XML from HDFS.
The Job runs on the Hadoop cluster.

Database:
All job related information is stored in the database.
Oozie supports Derby, MySQL,Oracle and PostgreSQL.
The Oozie package comes configured with Derby by default.
