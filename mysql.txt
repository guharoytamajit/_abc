components:
1.connection pool:users have connection to the database,which lives in a process thread,this connection executes statement on behalf of the user.

2.parser: converts SQL statements to internal commands

3.optimizer: Defines how the query(commands after parser) is executed in most effective way .

4.Cache/Buffer:hold data in memory

process hierarchy:
1.Supervisor process
2.mysqld ie. the main process
3.each connection consumes a thread


storage engine:
1.defines how data is saved
2.provides file structure,indexes and storage management

examples:InnoDB(default since mysql8),MyISAM(old default),NDB,Federated,Memory,Custom etc.


InnoDB(storage engine):
three parts:caching,transaction system,storage
provides ACID compliant transaction features

InnoDB transaction logs:
Are typically only written
Read only when there is a crash
Are rewritten over and over again

=================================================================================================
Manual installation:
1.extract the zip file we have downloaded
2.Add a data Folder and Create a Configuration File(my.ini) in home directory.
On MySQL version 5.6 and earlier, all of the data files are stored by default 
in a data folder, which is already included in the zip file that we downloaded.

However, starting from MySQL version 5.7, that folder has been removed and now, 
we are free to choose the name and the location of the folder.


3.Inside my.ini under [mysqld] section, add the following parameters(most of them are optional and has defaults):


[mysqld]
basedir = "/mysql-5.7.17"
datadir = "/mysql-5.7.17/data"
port = 3306
server_id = 1
log_error = "mysql_error.log"
pid_file = "mysql.pid"
socket = "/mysql-5.7.17/mysql.sock"

# Optional - Default Configuration
max_allowed_packet = 8M
key_buffer_size=16M

# Where do all the plugins live
plugin_dir = "/mysql-5.7.17/lib/plugin/"


4.Initialization For The First Time:

mysqld --initialize
or
mysqld --initialize-insecure

The Difference is: mysqld --initialize will create a random password that written to the log file, in this example mysql_log.log file located in the data folder.

While for mysqld --initialize-insecure, there is no password to be set, Nevertheless, we can still create a password later.

By default, the process will create a user to login with root as the username, we can define another username by adding --user option, e.g. mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=agusph

5.Now connect to mysql server:
>mysql -u root -p

6.turn off server:

mysqladmin -u root shutdown

7. restart server:
>mysqld
===============================================================================================
Or just do:
>mysqld --initialize --user=mysql  --datadir=../mydb 
===============================================================================================


test:
===server1.cfg=====
port=3307
datadir=data1
socket=data1/mysql.sock
pid=data1/mysql.pid 

#create database
mysql_install_db  --datadir=data1
note:mysql_install_db is present in mysql_home/script make sure it is added to path

#Starting mysql server
mysqld_safe  –-defaults-file=server1.cnf&

#connect
mysql -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld2.sock
or
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307



==================
cd <mysql_home>
mkdir data1                           #create data directory
mysqld --initialize  --datadir=data1  #create database
mysqld  --defaults-file=server1.cnf&

====================
working:
mysqld --initialize --user=mysql  --datadir=data1
