============================
Go packages:
Golang has two types of packages:
1)Executable=> Generates a file that can be run.
if the pakage name of file is "main" it becomes Executable package.
If this file has a main() function it will be executed on "go run" command or binary file execution.

2)Reusable(dependencies/libraries)=>Basically helper/utiliy reusable code
It package name is any ither than "main" then it is called reusable package and they dont creates any binary file on "go build" command
