node:an instance of ES(there are different types of nodes :master-eligible node,data node).
cluster:one or more instances of ES running on given network,identified by cluster name.
index:a logical namespace,it stores related data,index is broken into shards for scaling.
shard: a partition(partitions makes up an index),5 shards per index by default,shards are spread across multiple nodes by ES,It makes it distributed,robust and near real time.
       shards helps ES to scale,on every addition of nodes shards are redistributed to maintain a balance.
replicas:Duplication of primary shards,takes over if corresponding primary shard fails.

Add index:
curl -XPUT localhost:9200/<index_name>

Get all index:
curl -XGET localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v

Get a specific index:
curl -XGET localhost:9200/<index_name>?pretty

By default 5 primary shards and 1  shard replica created.

Add record:
PUT /index_name/type_name/5
{
"name":"adaasdadf",
account:30,
dob:"1990-03-09"
}
