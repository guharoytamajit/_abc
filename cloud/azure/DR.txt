Disaster can be because of :
natural disaster
hardware failure
cyberattacks
human errors
-----------
Disaster solutions:
1)Multiple data centers
-Secondary regions

2)Azure Traffic Manager:
-Automate trafficflow in unaffected regions

3)It assures 3 copies of data in same region for SQL databases.

4)Acailability sets for VM

5)Cosmos DB has automatic backup replicated to another region.
6)Mysql and Postgres has automatic backup as well.

----------------
Disaster Recovery Plan:
1)Planning
2)Testing
3)Same location
4)Different location(hot,warm or cold site)

-----------------
Recovery Time Objective(RTO):
Max Duration or length of time within which business must be functional after disaster(max downtime).
Achieved using "Azure Site Recovery"


Recovery point Objective(RPO):
Max amount of data that can be lost after a disaster.
Achieved using "Azure backup" 
We decide frequency of backup
=========================
Azure Backup:

Types of Azure Backups:
1)Files and Folders
2)Azure VM
3)Linux and Windows systems.
4)Hyper-V and VMware VM
5)System state
6)SQL Server, Sharepoint and Exchange workloads.
7)Bare Metal
8)Azure file share.
9)Azure SQL Database(long term backup)

Note: 
There is no egress charges for azure backup service.
All backups are incremental.
Storage is automatically provisioned for storing backup(pay for what we use).
Backup storage can be of type:
 a)Locally redundant storage(LRS)=> stores 3 copy of data within single region   
 b)Geo-redundant storage(GRS)=>Data is replicated to another region.Protects against regional outage.
Data is encrypted during transmission.

Constraints/limits:
25 recovery services or backup vaults per subscription
registers 50 machines per vault
200 Azure VM per vault 

--------------
Azure Recovery Vault:
This is the place which holds our backup.
