Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple  servers(eg ec2)
Helps in scaling
Makes our architecture more fault tolerant,as it can span more than one AZ in same region(HA across zones).
ELB gives user single point of access(DNS) to your application,which may have multiple instances.
Supports health checks,ELB will only forward traffic to healthy instances of your app.
Provide SSL termination(HTTPS) for your websites.
Enables sticky session using cookies.
ELB can separate public traffic from private traffic(No need to expose app instances or DB  on internet)


ELB is a managed load balancer(ie. AWS is responsible for its HA)
ELB can be internal(no public ip) or external(with public ip)
AWS supports 3 types of load balancers:
1)Classic load balancer(v1 old generation) since 2009,new deprecated
2)Application Load Balancer(v2 new generation) since 2016
3)Network Load balancer(v2 generation) since 2017
