CloudFormation:
Infrastructure as code.
deploy your aws resources through reusable templates.
A template is a simple text file that describes a stack.
Stack -collection of resources you want to deploy as a group.
json and yaml compatible. 

Can be used for replicating your infrastructure to other regions
Version control your infrastructure
Cloudformation is free
You pay for the resources created by cloudformation.

Templates can include a maximum of 9 main sections:
1.AWSTemplateFormatVersion: Template version you wish to use
2.Description: Text describing the template,must alwaysfollow the format version.
3.Metadata:Object that provide more info about template
4.Parameters: Values you can pass in to your template at runtime.
5.Mapping: Mapping of keys and associated values.
6.Conditions: control the creation of resources based on conditions being met;
 eg. Create different resources for test and prod env.
7.Transform: Version of the AWS SAM model(for serverless apps)
8.Resources(Required):the stack of resources to create. eg EC2 instances.
9.Outputs:  Can describe values that are returned from API call or the console
  eg. return the queue name of the SQS queue you have just created. 



Functions:
Fn::GetAtt=> Takes two parameters,the logical name of the resource and the name
           of the attribute to be retrieved.
Fn::FindInMap=> Pass the name of the map,the value used to find the mapped value,
           and the label of the mapped value you want to return.
Ref=>Returns a resource or value based on a logical name or a given parameter.
Fn::Join=> function takes two parameters
Fn::Select=> returns a single object from a list of objects by index
Fn::GetAZs=>Returns the list of all availability zones in a region
===============================
upload aws-cloudformation-master-master folder in s3 which has many templates.
CloudFormation>create new stack
select template from s3 named "0-just-ec2.yaml" with following content:

---
Resources:
  MyInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: ap-south-1a
      ImageId: ami-21815747
      InstanceType: t2.micro

This will create one ec2 instance with image:"ami-21815747" of type t2.micro in ap-northeast-1a AZ.
Give a stack name say "introduction"
You may add tags and complete creation of stack

It will create ec2 instance.
now if we delete the stack,it will also delete ec2 instance.
=========================
Commoon Options on create stack wizard:
1.Tags
 -all resources of this stack will share the provided tags
2.Permissions
  -providing Role ie. permissions that stack has.Similar to EC2 roles
3.Notification Options.
  -email or sms on any event
4.Timeouts
  -cloudformation should fail after a specific amount of time
5.Rollback and failure
  -on failure go back to its previous stable state
6.Stack policy
  -protect some resources. eg. prevent s3 bucket from deletion.
